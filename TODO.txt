FOR BSM TRANSMISSION AND BROADCASTING
- Messages are being read more than once from Bsm Server before they disappear. Find out why
- There may be something wrong with "check" mode in Bsm Server. Doublecheck it
- Change bsm server from .ipynb into .py

FOR OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING
- consider storing parameter object in Object class (I am not sure how pointers work in Python)
- Figure out how to fine-tune deep-sort model
- Check Qinglian's semi-supervised approach and employ it for detection
- Clean the mess with demo notebooks.

GENERAL
- Confirm with sniffer that it works (after Covid :>)
- Find a good (high resolution) stream
- Build set of parameters for the selected stream
- Migrate to Git-hub (probably two repositories). Where should I place COHDA code?
- Write a good README (one for each repository)
- Connect the Bsm Server with Zach's app
- Move everything to dedicated server (probably cannot do it online)
